# Shared RoCE GID-index selection for sparkrun's InfiniBand probes.
#
# Not executable on its own: included into ib_detect.sh through the
# "# sparkrun:include" directive, and substituted into the combined hardware
# probe (core/hardware_probe.py) verbatim.
#
# WHAT IT ANSWERS
# ---------------
# The index becomes NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX.  Peers address each other with
# IPv4-mapped GIDs (::ffff:a.b.c.d), so the only correct pin is the RoCE v2 GID
# carrying the port's IPv4 address.  The chain, first hit wins:
#
#   1. show_gids: the first "v2" row with an IPv4 address for this HCA.  This
#      is what a stock DGX OS host answers, unchanged from before this helper.
#   2. sysfs: the first RoCE v2 entry whose GID is IPv4-mapped.  For hosts
#      without show_gids.  The old fallback took the first RoCE v2 entry of any
#      kind -- on ConnectX that is index 1, the link-local fe80:: GID, which
#      bootstraps and then fails QP setup with "ibv_modify_qp: 22" (#327).
#   3. -1: NCCL's own dynamic selection (RoCE v2 + AF_INET by default, NCCL
#      2.21+; 2.32+ keeps -1 as an alias for AUTO).  The old last resort was a
#      hardcoded 3, which is right only on a port laid out like a Spark's.
#      When we cannot find the IPv4 GID ourselves, NCCL searching for the same
#      thing is strictly better than a guess.
#
# STYLE CONSTRAINT -- load-bearing, do not "tidy up":
#
#   No curly braces anywhere, not even in these comments.  The combined probe
#   is passed through Python's str.format(), which raises KeyError on any brace
#   appearing here.  That rules out awk programs (show_gids is parsed with
#   "read" instead) and the braced function-body syntax, which is why the
#   function is defined with a ( subshell ) body.
#
# Usage: IDX=$(sparkrun_rocev2_gid_index "<hca name>" "<hca sysfs dir>")
#
# Always prints an index.  Diagnostics go to stderr.
